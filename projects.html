    <h2>May 2015 - Present: Develope a personal website</h2>
    <p>
      I could have used SquareSpace or one of the many drag and drop sites but
      anyone was able to use those. This way I could do what I wanted and only
      had to pay to host the website. A link to the source code on GitHub can be
       found <a href="https://github.com/jcasey2/Website.git">here</a>.

    <h2>January 2015 - May 2015: 3D Printed TARDIS</br></h2>
    <p>
      I took a 3D printing class one semester and this was the final project for the class.
      It was open to all engineers so while the finished produc is not the best. I was for
      sure ahead on the coding part which threw the stuents who were not Computer Science
      majors for a loop since it used Object Oriented Programming methods which is something
      that is not taught until the second/third year of a Computer Science degree. Instuctables

    <h2>September 2015 - Present: Repositories for Class</h2>
    <p>
      Kept repositories of projects I did while in school. It could have started
      earlier but group projects were not comon and the programs themselves
      were not complicated enough to warrant a repository. These are private
      repositories because I didn't want to have other students stumble upon
      them and somehow get nabbed for giving other students my code. I think it
      was good prevention from getting kicked out of school.
