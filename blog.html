        <h3>Wednesday April 13, 2016:</h3>
        Big day today. Gave a 20 minute presentation about the dangers of software and unethical behavior in Ethics. Do not like giving
        presentations. Who does really? But this was not the biggest one I had ever given. I mean I had to give one in fromt of the CEO
        of Publix Supermarkets a couple years back and I survived. Now that one was way worse than this one.
        After that there was a recruiting event at the Microsoft store I attended. Not exactly what I was expecting though. Still
        I wasn't bad and was worth the hour and a half spent learning about all Microsoft had to offer as a company. It did serve to
        strenghten my desire to apply there for a job after graduation. Finals are coming up....always a stressful time in a college
        student's life. Stiff upper lip. It is my last full semester anyway so I have that going which is nice.

        <h3>Tuesday, April 5, 2016:</h3>
        Been awhile since I made a post. Been busy. With school and being a new parent is a lot. I do not know how single parents do it.
        The end of a semester is always the most stressful part of college. Everything culminates concurrently and you have no time to do
        anything else. Alas, it is for the betterment of me and my family so I can complain little. It is all alomsot over. I had to extend
        my graduation another semester to take....one class. At least it is at 8 in the morning and I can possibly get a job while that
        is happeneing.

        <h3>Friday, March 18th, 2016:</h3>
        Still on Spring break.....I do not like these weeks off from school. I try to get involved in some of my hobbies but whatever
        I do gets puhed back once school resumes and I cannot persue them when school is in session. School is paramount to the future
        of not ony me but also my family.I have seen and experienced what it is like working for a job that doesn't fit any of my
        interests and is just a job. I could have statyed doing what I was doing before I went back to school but it did not interest
        me in the slightest and had limited upside in the longterm. The company was great and I would consider working for them again
        but the situation has to be right. We shall see. Only three more classes after this semester. Anyway, I need to figure out how
        to password protect some of the URLs in my domain so that I can post pictures of how we are doing. Until next time!

        <h3>Wednesday, March 16th, 2016:</h3>
        First blog post. Not really sure what to say here. I'm new to this but, I can say that this website was started as a way
        for me to stand out against all other Computer Science students for a job. I think it is a creative way to get my name out
        there and see what people have to say about it. Making this website over the past few weeks in my spare time has been fun.
        Although it is no where near done, I figured i could start the blog part of the website while I build the rest. This website \
        can also serve as a way to udate family that we may not have contact with on a daily or weekly basis. More to come!
