      Hello! My name is John Casey and I am 29 years old, married and have one
      daughter born this year. I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at
      the University of South Florida in my last semester. Originally I am from
      the Boston area, Lynn specifically, but I have been in Florida for 27+
      years so I am basically a Floridian now. I am however a Boston sports fan,
      mostly Red Sox and Patriots, and to some extent the Bruins, and a passing
      interest in the Celtics. Right now we live in Ruskin, FL for the moment
      until I graduate and find a job either here or preferably somewhere else.
      I may eat those words depending on where we end up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why computer science? It is a trio of what I think people should go
      to college for. It is something that interests me, it is something that
      challenges me academically, and it is something that I can make a decent
      living at. It took me awhile to find out what I wanted to do. I am 29
      after all, not exactly typical college age. The first round in college
      did not go so well mostly because I did not know what I wanted to do for
      the next forty years. I think that is a lot to ask an eighteen year old
      adult. Especially one who is not lucky enough to have not found something
      that they are passionate about yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hobbies do not really correlate with each other nor do they only pertain
      to technical areas. I like to think that I am a jack of all trades but
      master of none. I enjoy anything from astronomy to carpentry. A short list
      of my favorite hobbies are: astronomy, photography, aviation, electronics,
      web development, video games, carpentry. The list really could go on and
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started this website as a way to stand out among the other computer
      science students vying for jobs. Still in it's infancy, this website plans
      on housing more about myself and my family as well as my professional
      career. Right now though it is just another hobby of mine that I work on
      in my free time while I have nothing else to do. Although it may have a
      primitive look to it now, I plan on making it look better as I get better
      at making a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is about it. If you would like to send an email to me feel free to
      visit the contact page and send an email. Write anything you would like
      (or don't like) about the website, me, or anything you want. Well maybe
      not anything. Don't be mean and we should be good. I do not expect much
      traffic here so anything is welcome. Other than that check out the rest of
      the site.
